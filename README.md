## Run backend server (api)

npm install
npm run dev
```

## Run vue frontend (for development)

npm run serve
```
### Compiles and minifies for production

## Configure API URL
Depending on whether you want to run the frontend with the live API or a local development API, follow these steps:
- Open agrotrade-frontend/src/services/Api.js 
- Change baseURL: 'https://agrotrade.shopitnow.gr/api' or baseURL: 'http://localhost:8081/api' accordingly.
- Uncomment the baseURL line by removing the // at the beginning of the line and comment the other one.


## Backend Folder and Files Structure
- `server.js`: The entry point of the application. It sets up the server, connects to the database, and starts listening for incoming requests.
- `src/app.js`: Initializes the Express application, sets up middleware, and defines the routes.
- `src/config`: Contains configuration files.
- `src/controllers`: Contains the logic for handling requests and responses.
- `src/middleware`: Contains middleware functions for processing requests.
- `src/models`: Contains database models.
- `src/routes`: Contains route definitions.
- `src/uploads`: Directory for storing uploaded files.
- `.env`: Environment variables file that stores sensitive or configuration-specific information.
- `package.json`: Configuration file for npm that includes the dependencies and scripts required to build, test, and run the frontend application.


## Frontend Folder and Files Structure
- `public/index.html`: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the application. Built files will be auto injected here.
- `src/assets/`: Contains static assets such as images, fonts, and global stylesheets used throughout the application.
- `src/components/`: Contains reusable Vue components that can be used across different pages or views of the application.
- `src/router/`: Contains the Vue Router configuration. Defines the application's navigation paths and corresponding components.
- `src/pages/`: Contains main views or pages of the application. Each page typically corresponds to a route defined in the Vue Router.
- `src/services/`: Contains API service modules that handle communication with the backend API. These modules encapsulate API endpoints and return responses to components.
- `src/App.vue`: The root Vue component that acts as the container for all other components. It typically includes the router-view to render the matched component for the current route.
- `src/main.js`: The entry point of the Vue application where Vue is instantiated and configured. It may include global configurations or plugins like Vuex for state management.
- `package.json`: Configuration file for npm that includes the dependencies and scripts required to build, test, and run the frontend application.
